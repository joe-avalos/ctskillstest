## PLEASE READ 
When I first applied, I  didn't know the test was going to be timed. I was busy at the time, and just downloaded the psd document.<br>
I had some time this weekend, and I started with the test from the document I had previously downloaded. I read the email, and saw that it would be timed and to not open the link until I was sure I could finish.<br>
Anyway, I completed the test and here's my code with a brief explanation. 

##Explanation
Frameworks used:
<li>React
<li>Material UI

I don't have Photoshop installed on my computer, so I had to make do with an online .psd viewer which limited my ability to make everything "pixel perfect", but I'm confident with the work I did.<br/>
I had to replace the _Myriad Pro_ font with _PT Sans_, because it is am Adobe proprietary font, and costs US$30 to download.<br>
I only set up a submenu on "Title 2" and a subsubmenu on "Title 2.2"<br>
The app is responsive, most elements work perfectly, but since this was not a requirement in the test, I didn't confirm every aspect of a responsive app.<br>
It took my approximately 4 hours to complete. The bulk of this time was spent customizing Material UI.<br/>
